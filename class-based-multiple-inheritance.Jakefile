/*
CLASS-BASED MULTIPLE INHERITANCE
Make a method 'createClass(className, [superclasses])'
It returns an object that points to the class.
Can only instantiate with superclasses that exist.
Note (task c): prevent infinite loop when using .call()

var class0 = createClass(class0, []);
class0.new();
obj0.class(funcName, []); //Search in class object for function, then look in inherited classes
